# Transcoding

## What is transcoding?
- from one codec to another
- Example:
  - Prores to H.264

## Why do we need transcode?
- quality
- compression
- storage
- editing / preview / streaming
- consuming application


## Transmuxing
- from one container to another
- Example: MXF -> MP4
- so basically it is  like repacking the content


## Thumbnail generation
- preview image
- search hit
- hover-scrubbing
- poster frame


## Frame rate conversion
- 25FPS - 30 FPS
- support different television standards (PAL/NTSC)
- Higher FPS: preserve slow motion quality for editing
- lower FPS: playback / streaming

## Bitrate conversion
- 50 Mbps -> 2 Mbps
- quality
- storage space
- support different network bandwidths

## Change GOP size
